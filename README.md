# KOS 🖥️

A tiny Python-based toy operating system made for fun and learning!  
Type commands in a shell-like interface and interact with features like **time, date, echo, uptime!** ✨


## 🚀 Features (till now)
- `help` → list all available commands  
- `echo <text>` → repeat text back  
- `time` → show current system time  
- `date` → show today’s date  
- `info` → show OS name, version, and author  
- `clear` → clear the terminal screen  
- `uptime` → show how long the OS has been running

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Make sure Python is installed.

## ▶️ Usage examples
Run the OS in your terminal:

- KOS> help
- KOS> echo Hello World!
- KOS> time
- KOS> uptime

## 🛠️ Roadmap (Milestones)
- v0.1 : Boot, `help`, `exit`, `echo` ✅
- v0.2 : `time`, `date`, `info`, `uptime` ✅
- v0.3 : `calc`, `clear`, `uptime` formatting ⏳ (`calc` in progress)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is **not** a real operating system, but a fun project to simulate one inside Python!
Perfect for learning loops, string handling, time modules.

## 🌌 Future ideas
- login with password and username
- sign out
- folder and file system
- games
- applications
- AI copilot
- soo much commands
